Hello World!
I'm glad to presentate a new application created by me. This is a simple timer that you can use to mark the time. The app contains some functions and does not ground on OOP, 'cause the app is to small to use these principals. I've also added an arrow with animation to make the app looking better. Thank you for checking the app out!
